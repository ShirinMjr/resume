      With dual bachelor's degrees and over 5 years of experience in testing enterprise-grade
      applications and platforms, I have honed my skills in ensuring software quality. I believe
      that software quality is a cross-functional responsibility, and I actively seek opportunities
      to expand my knowledge of new products and processes. By doing so, I bring fresh ideas and
      innovative solutions to the table, fostering a collaborative environment where we can learn,
      troubleshoot, and resolve problems to meet our team's goals.
