        • Eliminated 100% of flaky tests by
        implementing a test reliability process that increased test standards, reduced failures, and
        expedited the deployment process. • Created GitHub actions to tag, monitor, and report
        failing/flaky tests. • Worked independently to develop data/scenario strategies that
        minimized testing time. • Actively participated in source code management discussions,
        providing valuable input. • Participated in daily Scrum meetings, sprint planning, backlog
        grooming, and code reviews. • Advocated for software quality best practices by giving talks
        and creating collaborative groups. • Utilized various tools, including Slack bot, Honeycomb,
        Jira, and Notion, for effective test process management. • Actively involved in various
        groups, including WIT (Women in Technology), SURGE (Equal Opportunity for Underrepresented
        and Minority Groups), and Engineering Book and Podcast Club.
