    <p>
      • Joined as the first SDET and created and implemented new test automation (Cypress) while
      maintained project’s legacy test framework (Selenium). • Refactored and migrated 20% of the
      legacy tests from Selenium to the new framework Cypress. • Eliminated 100% of flaky tests by
      implementing a test reliability process that increased test standards, reduced failures, and
      expedited the deployment process. • Created GitHub actions to tag, monitor, and report
      failing/flaky tests. • Worked independently to develop data/scenario strategies that minimized
      testing time. • Actively participated in source code management discussions, providing
      valuable input. • Participated in daily Scrum meetings, sprint planning, backlog grooming, and
      code reviews. • Advocated for software quality best practices by giving talks and creating
      collaborative groups. • Utilized various tools, including Slack bot, Honeycomb, Jira, and
      Notion, for effective test process management. • Actively involved in various groups,
      including WIT (Women in Technology), SURGE (Equal Opportunity for Underrepresented and
      Minority Groups), and Engineering Book and Podcast Club.
